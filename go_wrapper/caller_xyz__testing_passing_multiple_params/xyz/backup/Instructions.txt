Files manually fixed after swig compilation:

Theoretically, we should be able to do this to create a Go wrapper module around a c project using Swig:
>$ swig -go -cgo -intgosize 64 xyz.i
(requires ps.c and xyz.i)
>$ go install
(requires xyz.go and xyz_wrap.c)
Then
>$ go mod init xyz


However, there is no clear way in Swig for Go to combine typemaps with gotypes in function calls.
So, I fixed manually this issue on the files automatically generated by Swig:
xyz.go
xyz_wrap.c

and then all seem to work when this module is called.

Problem, the function altered manually is 'create_file_params' that should be registered in the module I think when we call Swig, I don't really know.
So, any module using our module won't have the arguments correctly defined for 'xyz.Create_file_params([]string, string)', however this is not an issue in runtime; everything works.
